Study prompts for quiet days

Daily (5-10 minutes)
- Read the latest setup rules and restate them in your own words.
- Check yesterday's SPY daily bar and write the market context (trend/range/unclear).
- Review the last queued/ignored signal and note one reason it did not meet approval.
- Skim the no-trade log and see if a repeated reason is forming.

Weekly (20 minutes)
- Re-read the last weekly snapshot and highlight one mistake pattern.
- Compare the two setups: which one had better expectancy in the last 60 days?
- Pick one improvement idea and add a single change to the checklist.

Mindset
- Patience is a skill: no-trade days are data, not failure.
- The goal is rule-following and learning, not forcing trades.
